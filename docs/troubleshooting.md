# Troubleshooting

Common problems and how to resolve them. Every behaviour here is taken from the current code; nothing
is hypothetical. Run `raxd` inside Docker (security baseline §6) — see
[`development.md`](development.md).

All error messages follow the project format: a lowercase `error:` line describing what happened,
followed by one or more indented `hint:` lines describing what to do.

## `raxd serve`

### The server starts but every connection is rejected with 401

You have no active API keys, or you are not sending the key correctly.

- On startup with an empty `keys.db`, `serve` prints a warning:

  ```
  warning   no API keys found — all connections will be rejected
  hint      create a key with "raxd key create --name <label>"
  ```

  Create a key with `raxd key create --name <label>` and retry.

- If you do have keys, check the request header. The key must be sent as
  `Authorization: Bearer rax_live_…` (the full key body printed once by `key create`). A missing
  header, a non-`Bearer` scheme, or an empty token all produce `401` and a `FAIL` audit line:

  ```
  time=… level=WARN msg=FAIL fp=- remote=… reason="no authorization header"
  ```

- An unknown or **revoked** key also produces `401`, with a fingerprint in the audit line:

  ```
  time=… level=WARN msg=FAIL fp=b7d2a0c19f3e remote=… reason="authentication failed"
  ```

  Revocation takes effect immediately — a key you delete with `raxd key delete` stops working on its
  next request. Confirm the key is still active with `raxd key list`.

This applies to the MCP endpoint too: a `401` on `/mcp` means the same thing, and no tool runs
(including `execute_command` — no command is executed — and `upload_file` — no file is written). See
[MCP server (`/mcp`)](#mcp-server-mcp) below.

Note: response bodies for rejected requests are intentionally empty; the reason is only in the
server's audit stream. That is by design (it avoids telling a caller whether a key is unknown or
revoked).

### `error: cannot bind to 127.0.0.1:7822: address already in use`

The configured port is taken by another process (often a previous `raxd serve` you forgot to stop).

```
error: cannot bind to 127.0.0.1:7822: address already in use
  hint: check what is using port 7822 with "lsof -i :7822" and stop it, or change the port with "raxd config port <PORT>"
```

- Find and stop the other process (`lsof -i :7822`), or
- Change the port. `raxd config port` is still a stub, so edit `config.yaml` directly: set the
  `port:` key (see [`configuration.md`](configuration.md#networking-and-serve-fields)) and start
  `serve` again. The MCP endpoint follows the same port.

> If `raxd` is running as a registered service, a stale instance is most often the cause — stop it
> with `raxd service stop` (or check `raxd service status`) rather than killing it by hand. See
> [the service section](#raxd-service) below.

> **What you will (and will not) see.** When the port is in use, the bind fails before the server
> ever starts, so `serve` prints **only** the `error:` / `hint:` lines above and exits `1`. The
> startup block (`cert` / `key` / `tls` / `listening …` / `press Ctrl+C`) and the shutdown block do
> **not** appear — there is no misleading `listening …` line for a server that did not start. The
> startup block is emitted only after the listener is successfully bound (via the `OnListen` hook in
> `internal/server`), which matches how the certificate and permission errors below behave.

### `error: TLS certificate or key is corrupted or unreadable`

The files in the TLS directory exist but cannot be loaded as a valid pair — for example one of
`cert.pem` / `key.pem` is missing, truncated, or does not match the other.

```
error: TLS certificate or key is corrupted or unreadable
  hint: remove the files in /home/user/.local/state/raxd/tls/ and run "raxd serve" again to regenerate
```

`serve` never overwrites an existing certificate automatically. To recover, delete `cert.pem` **and**
`key.pem` from the TLS directory (default `~/.local/state/raxd/tls/`, shown by `raxd status` as the
`tls` line) and start `serve` again — it will generate a fresh self-signed pair.

> Implementation detail worth knowing: a completely **empty** (zero-byte) `cert.pem` or `key.pem` is
> treated as "not present", so if *both* files are zero-byte the server regenerates them rather than
> reporting corruption. The corruption error appears when the files have content that cannot be
> parsed, or when only one of the two exists. Either way, removing both files and restarting is the
> reliable fix.

### `error: cannot create TLS directory: permission denied`

`raxd` could not create the state/TLS directory.

```
error: cannot create TLS directory: permission denied
  hint: check that the current user has write access to ~/.local/state/raxd/
```

Make sure the current user can write under `~/.local/state/raxd/` (or wherever `XDG_STATE_HOME`
points). In a container, ensure the mounted path is writable by the container user.

### `error: cannot create upload root directory: …`

`raxd serve` could not create the upload root (default `<state directory>/uploads`). It is created
with `0700` permissions on startup, before the listener binds, so this error is a startup failure
(exit `1`) and the server does not start.

```
error: cannot create upload root directory: permission denied
```

Make sure the current user can write under the state directory (or wherever `upload.root` points if
you set it), and that any custom `upload.root` is a writable path. See
[`configuration.md`](configuration.md#file-upload-upload-fields).

### `error: failed to generate TLS certificate`

Certificate generation failed while writing to disk — typically no free space or no write permission
in the TLS directory.

```
error: failed to generate TLS certificate
  hint: check available disk space and write permissions for /home/user/.local/state/raxd/tls/
```

Free up space or fix permissions on the TLS directory and retry.

### `error: key store is corrupted or unreadable` (at startup)

`keys.db` exists but cannot be parsed. `serve` refuses to start and does not modify the file.

```
error: key store is corrupted or unreadable
  hint: check file permissions on the keys.db path shown in "raxd status"
  hint: do not attempt to repair the file manually — contact support if data recovery is needed
```

Check that the file is readable by the current user (`raxd status` shows the path). Do not hand-edit
`keys.db`. A *missing* `keys.db` is **not** an error — it is treated as an empty store (the server
starts and warns).

### Configuration load errors share one generic hint

Both config-load failures below — an **invalid bind address** and an **invalid `config.yaml`** — come
out of the same code path in `serve` (the `config.Load` step). That single path prints **one generic
hint** that always references `bind_addr` / `config.yaml`, regardless of which of the two actually
failed. The `error:` line always tells you the real cause; the `hint:` line is **not** specialised
per cause. So:

- **Trust the `error:` line** — it carries the underlying message from `config.Load` and names the
  actual problem.
- **Read the `hint:` line as "fix your `config.yaml`"** rather than literally "the problem is
  `bind_addr`". For a YAML-syntax error the `bind_addr` mention is incidental.

The two concrete cases follow. (Note: an invalid `upload.max_file_bytes` or `upload.default_mode` is
also a `config.Load` failure and surfaces through this same path — the `error:` line names the upload
field; see [the `upload_file` section](#the-upload_file-tool) below.)

### `error: invalid bind address "…": not a valid IP address`

`bind_addr` in `config.yaml` is not a valid IP. Here the cause and the generic hint line up:

```
error: invalid bind address "0.0.0.256": not a valid IP address
  hint: set a valid address in config.yaml (field: bind_addr), for example "127.0.0.1" or "0.0.0.0"
```

Set `bind_addr` to a valid IP literal. The default `127.0.0.1` binds to loopback only; `0.0.0.0`
exposes the server beyond the host (your responsibility to secure).

### `error: config file is not valid YAML`

The `config.yaml` file exists but is not valid YAML. Fix the syntax. A *missing* file is not an
error — the defaults are applied (and `raxd status` shows `(not found, defaults applied)`).

> **Heads-up: the hint here mentions `bind_addr`, but the real problem is YAML syntax.** Because the
> invalid-YAML case and the invalid-bind-address case are handled by the **same** `config.Load`
> error path in `serve`, a malformed `config.yaml` produces the **same generic hint** as a bad bind
> address:
>
> ```
> error: config file is not valid YAML: <parser detail>
>   hint: set a valid address in config.yaml (field: bind_addr), for example "127.0.0.1" or "0.0.0.0"
> ```
>
> Ignore the `bind_addr` part in this situation. The actionable line is the `error:` one
> (`config file is not valid YAML`): correct the YAML syntax in `config.yaml` (indentation, quoting,
> a stray tab, an unterminated string, etc.) and start `serve` again. This is the same `error:` you
> would see from any tool that fails to parse the file.

### `curl` to `/healthz` or `/mcp` fails with a TLS / certificate error

The server uses a **self-signed** certificate, so a client that verifies certificates will reject it
by default. There is no built-in trust anchor and no mTLS in this build.

- For a controlled local test, skip verification: `curl -k -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY"
  https://127.0.0.1:7822/healthz`.
- Otherwise, add the generated `cert.pem` to your client's trust store. The certificate's SAN covers
  `127.0.0.1` and `localhost`, so connect using one of those names/addresses.
- For Node-based MCP clients (MCP Inspector and similar) in development, set
  `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0` in the client's environment (insecure — dev only). See
  [`mcp.md`](mcp.md#self-signed-tls).

### A request returns `501 Not Implemented`

This is expected for an **unimplemented** route. After authentication, the routes that do real work
are `GET /healthz` (returns `pong`) and `/mcp` (the MCP server). Every other path (for example
`/exec`) returns `501` with the body `not implemented`. Note that command execution and file upload
are **not** separate routes: they are the MCP `execute_command` and `upload_file` tools on `/mcp`, not
`/exec` or `/upload` endpoints. There is nothing to fix about the `501` on other paths — those routes
are simply unimplemented.

> **`/mcp` no longer returns `501`.** If you used an older build, the MCP route was a `501` stub. In
> the current build, `POST /mcp` with a valid key returns a real JSON-RPC response. If you still get
> `501` on `/mcp`, you are running an old binary — rebuild. (A `GET /mcp` returns `405`, not `501` —
> see the MCP section below.)

### A request returns `413` or `400` for an oversized body (and nothing shows up in the audit stream)

The request body exceeded `max_body_bytes` (default 1 MiB). The rejection is produced by the
outermost body-size limit (`http.MaxBytesReader`), which sits **before** the auth and audit
middlewares — so, unlike the `401` / `403` / `429` cases, it **does not** write any audit line
(`FAIL` / `DENY` / `RATE`). If you are debugging an oversized request, do not look for it in the audit
stream: confirm it from the client side (the response code) instead. Reduce the request body or raise
`max_body_bytes` in `config.yaml` (see
[`configuration.md`](configuration.md#networking-and-serve-fields)).

> **`413` vs `400` — which one you see depends on the route.**
> - For a plain non-MCP route, the body limit surfaces as **`413`**.
> - For an **`upload_file`** request on `/mcp`, an oversized body surfaces (in this build) as an HTTP
>   **`400`** with "failed to read body" — this comes from the Go MCP SDK reading the truncated
>   `MaxBytesReader`, **not** a `413`. (The project spec/mcp-spec mention `413`; the SDK returns `400`
>   here. This is a documentation caveat, **not** a defect — the body is rejected before the handler
>   and **no file is written**.) See [`mcp.md`](mcp.md#upload_file) for the full caveat.
>
> Either way, the rejection is **silent in the audit stream** — confirm an oversized request by the
> response code, not by grepping the audit log.

> Note: large `execute_command` arguments are bounded twice — first by `max_body_bytes` (the whole
> JSON-RPC body), then by `exec.max_args` / `exec.max_arg_len`. An oversized body means the **whole
> request** was too big; an `isError: true` with a "too many arguments" / "argument too long" message
> means the request was fine but the per-argument limits were exceeded (see
> [the `execute_command` section](#the-execute_command-tool) below). The analogous distinction for
> `upload_file` (body limit vs `upload.max_file_bytes`) is in
> [the `upload_file` section](#the-upload_file-tool).

### A request returns `429 Too Many Requests`

You exceeded the rate limit. Limiting is a token bucket applied **per key and per client IP** with a
sustained `rate_limit` (default 10 req/s) and a `rate_burst` (default 20). The audit line shows which
limit was hit:

```
time=… level=WARN msg=RATE fp=a3f9c1d2e847 remote=… reason="rate limit exceeded (key)"
time=… level=WARN msg=RATE fp=- remote=… reason="rate limit exceeded (ip)"
```

Slow down, or raise `rate_limit` / `rate_burst` in `config.yaml` (see
[`configuration.md`](configuration.md#networking-and-serve-fields)). This rate limit also applies to
MCP calls on `/mcp`, including `execute_command` and `upload_file` — when the limit is hit the call is
rejected with `429` **before** any command runs or any file is written.

### A request returns `403 Forbidden`

Three different conditions map to `403`; the audit line's `reason` tells them apart:

- `reason="invalid host header"` — the request's `Host` is not in `host_allow`. By default only
  `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, and `::1` are allowed.
- `reason="invalid origin header"` — an `Origin` header was present and its hostname is not in
  `origin_allow`. (A request with no `Origin` is allowed — that is the normal case for non-browser
  clients.) Matching is strict on the hostname, so `https://localhost.evil.com` does not pass
  `localhost`.
- `reason="key store unavailable"` — the key store became unreadable while the server was running.

Adjust `host_allow` / `origin_allow` in `config.yaml` if you are connecting under a different name,
and connect using a host the certificate covers (`127.0.0.1` or `localhost`).

### The server seems to hang and prints nothing

That is the normal, healthy state. `raxd serve` is a long-running process: after the startup block it
blocks and prints **only** an audit line per connection. Silence means no connections are arriving;
there are no heartbeat messages. Press Ctrl+C to stop it (graceful shutdown, exit `0`).

## `raxd service`

Problems registering or running `raxd` as a system service. The full command reference is in
[`commands.md`](commands.md#raxd-service); the security and operations model is in
[`service-management.md`](service-management.md). Remember the systemd integration is exercised in a
privileged systemd-in-Docker container, while the macOS launchd path is verified on a real macOS host
(see [`service-management.md`](service-management.md#5-the-macos-path-is-not-tested-in-docker)).

### `error: insufficient privileges to install the service`

`install`, `uninstall`, `start`, and `stop` write to system directories and call the service manager,
so they require root.

```
error: insufficient privileges to install the service
  hint: run as root or with sudo: sudo raxd service install
  hint: installation requires root to write system service files
```

Run the command with `sudo`. `raxd` does **not** silently fall back to anything when it lacks
privileges — there is no risk of a partially-installed or root-running daemon from a non-root attempt.

> Installing needs root, but the **daemon** does not run as root: the generated unit/plist set
> `User=raxd` / `UserName=raxd`, so the running service is the unprivileged `raxd` user. The
> `insufficient privileges` error is only about the installer's write access, not the daemon. See
> [`service-management.md`](service-management.md#1-non-root-execution).

`raxd service status` does **not** require root — you can always inspect the state without `sudo`.

### `error: service manager is not available`

`raxd` could not reach the OS service manager (`systemctl` on Linux, `launchctl` on macOS) — it is
not present, or the init system is not the expected one.

```
error: service manager is not available
  hint: ensure systemd (Linux) or launchd (macOS) is running
```

- On Linux, this means `systemd` is not the init system (or `systemctl` is missing). A plain
  container without systemd as PID 1 cannot host the service — the systemd integration is tested in a
  dedicated privileged systemd container (see
  [`service-management.md`](service-management.md#where-this-runs)). On a normal Linux host with
  systemd, confirm `systemctl` is on `PATH`.
- On a non-Linux, non-macOS platform `raxd` cannot manage a service at all and reports
  `error: this platform is not supported` with the hint that service management is available on Linux
  and macOS only.

### The service installed but will not start (crash-loop)

If `raxd service start` succeeds but `raxd service status` keeps showing the daemon stopped or with a
changing PID, the daemon is failing to start under the service. Inspect the logs:

- **Linux:** `journalctl -u raxd -e` (the audit stream and any startup error go to journald). Look
  for the same `serve` startup errors documented under [`raxd serve`](#raxd-serve) above (port in
  use, TLS directory permission, corrupt `keys.db`, bad `config.yaml`, upload-root permission).
- **macOS:** check the log file `/usr/local/var/log/raxd/raxd.log` (the plist's `StandardErrorPath`).

Common service-specific causes:

- **Directory ownership/permissions.** The service runs as `raxd`, so its state directory
  (`/var/lib/raxd` on Linux, `/usr/local/var/raxd` on macOS) and config directory (`/etc/raxd` /
  `/usr/local/etc/raxd`) must exist and be owned by `raxd` with mode `0700`. On Linux systemd creates
  `/var/lib/raxd` and `/etc/raxd` for you (via `StateDirectory` / `ConfigurationDirectory`) before
  the daemon starts; on macOS `install` creates them. If you changed ownership by hand, restore
  `raxd:raxd` ownership and `0700`.
- **A privileged port without the capability.** If you set `port:` to a value `< 1024` after the
  service was installed for the default port, the running unit may not have `CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE` and
  the bind will fail with a permission error. Re-run `sudo raxd service install` (after `uninstall`)
  so the regenerated unit gains the capability — see the next entry.

### A privileged port (< 1024) fails to bind

By default `raxd` listens on `7822`, which is unprivileged and binds fine as the `raxd` user. If you
set `port:` in `config.yaml` to a value below `1024` (for example `443`), the daemon needs the
`CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE` capability to bind it without being root.

`raxd service install` reads the port from `config.yaml` at install time and adds the capability to
the generated unit **only** when the port is `< 1024`. So:

1. Set the privileged `port:` in `config.yaml` first.
2. Then run `sudo raxd service install` (uninstall first if it is already installed) so the
   regenerated unit includes `CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE`.

If you changed the port without re-installing, the old unit lacks the capability and the bind fails.
The capability granted is only `CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE` — never full root or setuid-root. See
[`service-management.md`](service-management.md#2-privileged-ports--1024-and-the-network-capability).
On macOS the privileged-port mechanics are an open question verified on a real macOS host; keeping the
default `7822` avoids the issue entirely.

### `error: raxd service is not installed`

You ran `raxd service start` or `raxd service stop` before installing the service.

```
error: raxd service is not installed
  hint: install it first with "raxd service install"
```

Install it first with `sudo raxd service install`. Note the asymmetry: `start` and `stop` on an
absent service are **errors** (exit `1`), but `uninstall` on an absent service is a **no-op success**
(exit `0`, with a `not installed` message). A `raxd service status` on an absent service is also a
clean exit `0` showing `installed no`.

### `install` says "already installed"

Re-running `install` on an installed service is safe — it does **not** create a duplicate and is
**not** an error:

```
  already installed   raxd service
  hint: use "raxd service status" to check the current state
```

The command exits `0`. To change the configuration of an installed service (for example after editing
`port:`), `uninstall` first, then `install` again.

### After `uninstall`, the `raxd` user is still there

That is deliberate. `uninstall` removes the unit/plist, disables autostart, and removes the journald
drop-in, but it **intentionally keeps** the system user `raxd` (no login shell, no home, no longer
running) — removing a system user is riskier than keeping an inert one (UID-reuse). The success block
says so:

```
  kept          system user "raxd" (no shell, no home, not running)
  hint: to also remove the user: sudo userdel raxd
```

If you need a zero-footprint removal, delete the user yourself **after** confirming it owns nothing
you still need:

- **Linux:** `sudo userdel raxd`
- **macOS:** `sudo dscl . -delete /Users/raxd`

The state directory is **not** removed by `uninstall` either, so `keys.db` and any data survive.
(The uninstall hint names the real, platform-specific state directory: `/var/lib/raxd` on Linux,
`/usr/local/var/raxd` on macOS.) See
[`service-management.md`](service-management.md#3-the-raxd-user-is-kept-after-uninstall).

### The journal fills up despite the size cap

`install` writes a journald drop-in (`/etc/systemd/journald.conf.d/raxd.conf`) with
`SystemMaxUse=200M` and `SystemMaxFileSize=50M`. These limits are **per-host** (they apply to the
whole journal, not just the `raxd` unit). On a host shared with other heavily-logging services the cap
is shared among all of them.

- Confirm the drop-in is present and applied: `systemctl restart systemd-journald` after install, then
  `journalctl --disk-usage`.
- For a limit isolated to `raxd`, switch the daemon to file output and add a `logrotate` config — the
  documented fallback (see
  [`service-management.md`](service-management.md#4-audit-log-rotation)).

On macOS there is no journald; rotation of `/usr/local/var/log/raxd/raxd.log` is done with `newsyslog`
and is verified on a real macOS host.

### The service stopped and did not come back

That is correct for a **graceful stop**. `raxd service stop` sends `SIGTERM`, the daemon exits cleanly
(code `0`), and the restart policy (`Restart=on-failure` on Linux, `KeepAlive.SuccessfulExit=false` on
macOS) does **not** restart a clean exit. The service stays stopped until you `raxd service start` it.
The manager only restarts the service after a **crash** (a non-zero exit or `kill -9`). See
[`service-management.md`](service-management.md#6-restart-on-failure-vs-graceful-stop).

## MCP server (`/mcp`)

The MCP server runs inside `raxd serve` on the `/mcp` route. Most MCP problems are the transport
problems above (auth, TLS, Origin, rate limit), because MCP sits behind the same chain. The MCP-only
cases:

### `GET /mcp` returns `405 Method Not Allowed`

Expected. The server is **stateless** and does not offer a server→client SSE stream, so it answers
`GET /mcp` with `405`. MCP requests use `POST`. Send a JSON-RPC request with `POST`:

```sh
curl -k https://127.0.0.1:7822/mcp \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json, text/event-stream" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":3,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"ping","arguments":{}}}'
```

### A `tools/call` returns a JSON-RPC error instead of running

- **Unknown tool name** (for example a typo like `exec` instead of `execute_command`, or `upload`
  instead of `upload_file`) → error code `-32602` (`Invalid params`). Only `ping`, `server_info`,
  `execute_command`, and `upload_file` are registered. No command runs and no file is written. See
  [`mcp.md`](mcp.md#behaviour-and-error-handling).
- **Unknown method** → `-32601`. **Malformed JSON** → `-32700`. **Not a valid JSON-RPC request** →
  `-32600`.

These are JSON-RPC errors returned with HTTP `200`, not transport `4xx`/`501`. After such an error
the server stays up, and a valid `ping` still returns `pong`.

> Do not confuse a JSON-RPC `-32602` ("unknown tool name") with a **tool result** that has
> `isError: true`. The former means the tool name was wrong and nothing was dispatched; the latter
> means the tool *was* called but the operation was rejected or could not complete (see the
> [`execute_command`](#the-execute_command-tool) and [`upload_file`](#the-upload_file-tool) sections
> below).

### An MCP client cannot connect even though `curl` works

Some MCP clients/versions do not forward custom headers (such as `Authorization`) during their
initial health/`initialize` step. If `curl` (which sends the header reliably) succeeds but a client
does not, the issue is likely on the client side. Verify the channel with the `curl` smoke-test in
[`mcp.md`](mcp.md#curl-smoke-test) first. Also confirm the client is configured as a
**streamable-http** (remote) server with the `url` and `Authorization` header, **not** as a stdio
command, and that it trusts the self-signed certificate (or has verification disabled for dev).

## The `execute_command` tool

`execute_command` runs a command on the host. Unlike `ping`/`server_info`, it can fail in
command-specific ways. The full contract is in [`mcp.md`](mcp.md#execute_command); the security
warnings are in [`execute-command-security.md`](execute-command-security.md). This section is for
diagnosing a call.

### A command returns `isError: true`

`isError: true` means the command was **rejected or could not start** — it does **not** mean a
command ran and failed. (A command that ran and failed has a non-zero `exit_code` and `isError`
absent/false — see [the next entry](#a-command-that-exits-non-zero-or-times-out-is-not-an-error).)
The cases, and the matching audit line:

| Symptom (text content) | Cause | Audit |
|------------------------|-------|-------|
| `command not found` | the binary does not exist, is a relative path, or `cwd` is invalid | `msg=FAIL … reason=not-found` / `reason=bad-cwd` |
| `command not allowed` | the allowlist is on and the command is not in it | `msg=DENY … reason=not-allowed` |
| `too many arguments: N > M` | more than `exec.max_args` arguments | `msg=DENY … reason=…` |
| `argument too long: N > M` | a single argument longer than `exec.max_arg_len` | `msg=DENY … reason=…` |
| `timeout_ms N exceeds max M` | the requested `timeout_ms` is above `exec.max_timeout_ms` | `msg=DENY … reason=…` |
| `execution as root is forbidden by policy` | `deny_root: true` and the daemon is root | `msg=WARN reason=running-as-root` then `msg=DENY` |
| `validating "arguments": additional properties not allowed: …` | an unknown input field (for example `env`, `shell`) | none (rejected by the SDK before the handler) |

How to act on each:

- **`command not found`.** This **same** client text covers two distinct causes: (1) the binary does
  not exist (or is a relative path), and (2) an **invalid `cwd`** — a working directory you passed
  that does not exist or is not a directory. The response body is identical in both cases, so the
  client alone cannot tell them apart; **use the audit line's `reason=` to distinguish them**:
  `reason=not-found` is the binary case, `reason=bad-cwd` is the invalid-`cwd` case. To fix the binary
  case, check the binary is installed in the container and on the daemon's `PATH`, and use a bare name
  resolved on `PATH` (for example `ls`) or an **absolute** path (for example `/bin/ls`) — a
  **relative** path (for example `./tool`) is always rejected. To fix the `cwd` case, pass a `cwd`
  that exists and is a directory (or omit `cwd` to use `exec.default_cwd`, default `/tmp`).
- **`command not allowed`.** The allowlist (`exec.allowlist`) is on and your `command` string is not
  an exact match. Remember `ls` ≠ `/bin/ls`: list the command **exactly** the way you call it. See
  [the allowlist note](configuration.md#command-execution-exec-fields).
- **Argument / timeout limits.** Reduce the number/length of `args`, or lower `timeout_ms` below
  `exec.max_timeout_ms`. These limits are configurable in `config.yaml` (`exec.max_args`,
  `exec.max_arg_len`, `exec.max_timeout_ms`).
- **`execution as root is forbidden by policy`.** `deny_root: true` is set and the daemon is running
  as root. Run `raxd` as a non-root user, or set `deny_root: false` (which downgrades the refusal to a
  per-call `WARN` — the command then runs as root, which is itself risky). The simplest way to run
  non-root is to register `raxd` as a service, which runs the daemon as the `raxd` user — see
  [`service-management.md`](service-management.md#1-non-root-execution).
- **`additional properties not allowed`.** Remove the unknown field. The only accepted fields are
  `command`, `args`, `timeout_ms`, `cwd`. There is no `env` field.

### A command that exits non-zero or times out is **not** an error

This trips people up. Two normal outcomes are **not** reported as `isError`:

- **Non-zero exit code.** If the command runs and exits with a non-zero code, the result is a normal
  success: `isError` is absent/false and `exit_code` carries the value. The audit line is
  `msg=MCP … result=ok …`. Inspect `exit_code` / `stderr` in `structuredContent` to decide what to do.
- **Timeout (`timed_out: true`).** If the command runs longer than its timeout, it is killed (the
  whole process tree), and the result is again **not** an error: `isError` is absent/false,
  `timed_out: true`, with whatever partial output was captured. `exit_code` is reported as `-1` in
  this case — treat `timed_out` as the authoritative field. The audit line is
  `msg=MCP … result=ok … timed_out=true`.

So if you expected an error and got a "successful" result with a non-zero `exit_code` or
`timed_out: true`, that is by design: the command **did** run.

### Output looks cut off (`stdout_truncated` / `stderr_truncated`)

Each output stream is capped at `exec.max_output_bytes` (default 1 MiB). When a stream reaches the
cap, the captured output is truncated and the matching flag (`stdout_truncated` or
`stderr_truncated`) is `true`. This is not an error — it protects the daemon from a runaway,
high-output command. If you genuinely need more, raise `exec.max_output_bytes` in `config.yaml` (see
[`configuration.md`](configuration.md#command-execution-exec-fields)), bearing in mind the memory
cost.

### Reading the `execute_command` audit lines

Every call writes its own audit record to the `stderr` audit stream. To watch only command execution:

```sh
raxd serve 2>&1 | grep "tool=execute_command"
```

When `raxd` runs as a service on Linux, the audit stream is in journald — use
`journalctl -u raxd -f | grep "tool=execute_command"` instead.

What to look for:

- `msg=MCP … result=ok` — the command ran. Read `exit_code=`, `duration=`, `timed_out=`.
- `msg=DENY … reason=…` — the command was rejected (allowlist, limits, `deny_root`); it did not run.
- `msg=FAIL … reason=…` — the command could not start; it did not run. The `reason=` tells you which
  case: `reason=not-found` (the binary does not exist or is a relative path) or `reason=bad-cwd` (an
  invalid working directory) — note that both surface the same `command not found` text to the client.
- `msg=WARN … reason=running-as-root` — an extra record written on **every** call when the daemon is
  root. If you see this, the daemon is running as root and every command runs as root. Fix the
  deployment (run non-root — for example via [`raxd service`](service-management.md#1-non-root-execution))
  or set `exec.deny_root: true`.

> **Arguments are logged verbatim.** The `args=[…]` field shows exactly what the client sent, with no
> masking. If you find a secret in the audit log, the client put it in `args` — do not do that. See
> [the security guide](execute-command-security.md#1-do-not-pass-secrets-in-command-arguments-argv).

## The `upload_file` tool

`upload_file` writes a file to the host inside the upload root. Like `execute_command`, it can fail in
tool-specific ways. The full contract is in [`mcp.md`](mcp.md#upload_file); the security warnings are
in [`file-upload-security.md`](file-upload-security.md). This section is for diagnosing a call.

### An upload returns `isError: true`

`isError: true` means the write was **rejected by a control** or **failed mid-write** — no successful
upload reports `isError`. The cases, the client text, and the matching audit line:

| Symptom (text content) | Cause | Audit |
|------------------------|-------|-------|
| `path is outside the upload root` | the `path` escapes the root: a `..`-segment, an absolute path, or an out-of-root symlink | `msg=DENY … reason=traversal` |
| `file already exists (set overwrite to replace)` | the target exists and `overwrite` is `false` (the default) | `msg=DENY … reason="file already exists"` |
| `target path is a directory` | the `path` points at an existing directory, not a file | `msg=DENY … reason="target is a directory"` |
| `file too large: exceeds max_file_bytes` | the **decoded** content is larger than `upload.max_file_bytes` (default 700 KiB) | `msg=DENY … reason="file too large"` |
| `invalid base64 content` | `content` is not valid standard base64 | `msg=DENY … reason="invalid base64 content"` |
| `invalid file mode` | `mode` is unparseable, has a bit outside `0777` (setuid/setgid/sticky/higher), or is world-writable | `msg=DENY … reason="invalid file mode"` |
| `upload as root is forbidden by policy` | `upload.deny_root: true` and the daemon is root | `msg=WARN reason=running-as-root` then `msg=DENY` |
| `write failed` | an I/O error during the write (for example a full disk) | `msg=FAIL … reason="write failed"` |
| `validating "arguments": …` | an unknown input field, a wrong type, or a missing required `path`/`content` | none (rejected by the SDK before the handler) |

How to act on each:

- **`path is outside the upload root`.** The `path` must be **relative** and stay inside the root.
  Drop any leading `/`, remove `..` segments, and do not target a symlink that points outside the
  root. Missing intermediate sub-directories inside the root are created for you, so a path like
  `scripts/sub/deploy.sh` is fine even if `scripts/sub` does not exist yet.
- **`file already exists (set overwrite to replace)`.** A file already exists at that path and
  `overwrite` defaulted to `false`. To replace it, send `overwrite: true` (the replace is atomic). To
  keep both, choose a different `path`.
- **`target path is a directory`.** You pointed `path` at an existing directory. Choose a file path
  (for example `dir/file.txt`, not `dir`).
- **`file too large: exceeds max_file_bytes`.** The decoded content is over `upload.max_file_bytes`.
  This is the **per-file** limit (default 700 KiB). It is distinct from the **transport body limit**:
  if the **whole request body** is too big you get an HTTP `400`/`413` *before* the tool (no audit
  line, see [the oversized-body entry](#a-request-returns-413-or-400-for-an-oversized-body-and-nothing-shows-up-in-the-audit-stream))
  — whereas this `isError: true` deny means the body was fine but the decoded file exceeded the
  per-file cap. Send a smaller file, or raise `upload.max_file_bytes` (it must stay below the ceiling
  derived from `max_body_bytes`; see [`configuration.md`](configuration.md#file-upload-upload-fields)).
- **`invalid base64 content`.** Encode the file as **standard** base64 with padding. A common mistake
  is sending URL-safe base64 (`-`/`_` instead of `+`/`/`) or stripping the `=` padding.
- **`invalid file mode`.** Use an octal string with only `0777` permission bits, for example `"0600"`,
  `"0644"`, `"0700"`, `"0755"`. setuid (`"04000"`), setgid (`"02000"`), sticky (`"01000"`), higher
  bits (`"010000"`), and world-writable values (`"0666"`, `"0002"`) are rejected. See
  [the mode policy](file-upload-security.md#4-file-mode-policy--only-0777-permission-bits-default-0600).
- **`upload as root is forbidden by policy`.** `upload.deny_root: true` is set and the daemon is root.
  Run `raxd` as a non-root user, or set `upload.deny_root: false` (which downgrades the refusal to a
  per-call `WARN` — the file is then written as root, which is itself risky). Registering `raxd` as a
  service runs the daemon non-root for you — see
  [`service-management.md`](service-management.md#1-non-root-execution).
- **`write failed`.** A genuine I/O error (often a full disk, or a permission problem on the upload
  root). Check free space and that the upload root is writable (`0700`, owned by the daemon user). No
  partial or temp file is left behind. See the next entry.
- **`validating "arguments": …`.** Remove the unknown field, fix the type, or supply the missing
  required field. The only accepted fields are `path`, `content`, `overwrite`, `mode`; `path` and
  `content` are required.

### `error: cannot create upload root directory` / permission denied on the upload root

If `raxd serve` cannot create the upload root at startup, see
[the startup entry above](#error-cannot-create-upload-root-directory-). If the root exists but a write
fails at runtime with `write failed`, the upload root is probably not writable by the daemon user.
Check:

- the upload root exists and is owned by the user running `raxd` (default `<state directory>/uploads`,
  permissions `0700`);
- there is free disk space (there is **no** total-size quota — the per-file limit does not stop the
  disk filling up; see [the security guide](file-upload-security.md#7-residual-risks-out-of-scope-for-this-version));
- any custom `upload.root` you set is a writable absolute path.

### Reading the `upload_file` audit lines

Every call writes its own audit record to the `stderr` audit stream. To watch only file uploads:

```sh
raxd serve 2>&1 | grep "tool=upload_file"
```

When `raxd` runs as a service on Linux, use `journalctl -u raxd -f | grep "tool=upload_file"`.

What to look for:

- `msg=MCP … result=ok path=<rel> size=<N>` — the file was written. `path=` is the relative path and
  `size=` is the byte count (plain integer).
- `msg=DENY … reason=…` — the write was rejected by a control (traversal, exists, is-a-directory,
  too-large, bad base64, bad mode, `deny_root`); nothing was written.
- `msg=FAIL … reason="write failed"` — an I/O error during the write; nothing usable was written and
  the temp file was cleaned up.
- `msg=WARN … reason=running-as-root` — an extra record written on **every** call when the daemon is
  root. If you see this, the daemon is running as root and every file is written as root. Fix the
  deployment (run non-root) or set `upload.deny_root: true`.

> what the client sent (auto-quoted as a logfmt value). If you find a secret in the audit log, the
> client put it in `path` — do not do that. The file content never appears in the log. See
> [the security guide](file-upload-security.md#2-do-not-put-secrets-in-the-destination-path).

## Key management

### `error: key store is corrupted or unreadable` (from `key create` / `key delete`)

Same `keys.db` corruption as above, surfaced by a key command. The file is never overwritten.

```
error: key store is corrupted or unreadable
  hint: check file permissions on keys.db (must be readable by current user)
  hint: do not attempt to repair the file manually — contact support if data recovery is needed
```

### `error: key "…" not found` / `is already revoked`

The id passed to `raxd key delete` does not match an active key.

```
error: key "d7bc3a34da19d94e" not found
  hint: run "raxd key list" to see available key IDs
```

Run `raxd key list` to see active ids and pass the full 16-character id. A revoked key reports
`is already revoked` and never reappears in `key list`.

### I lost the key body

It cannot be recovered. The full `rax_live_…` key is shown **only once**, by `key create`. `keys.db`
stores only a salted hash, so the key cannot be read back from disk and no command reprints it.
Revoke the lost key (`raxd key delete <id>`) and create a new one.

## Configuration

### `config.yaml` changes have no effect

Only `raxd serve` reads `config.yaml` today, and it reads the file **at startup**. Restart `serve`
after editing the file. This includes the `exec.*` and `upload.*` keys — changing the allowlist,
timeouts, limits, the upload root, the size limit, the default mode, or either `deny_root` requires a
`serve` restart to take effect. When `raxd` runs as a service, restart it with `raxd service stop`
then `raxd service start`. The other commands (`version`, `status`, the `key` group) do not act on the
config values, except that `raxd service install` reads `port:` to decide on the privileged-port
capability. `raxd config port` is a stub and does not write the file — edit `config.yaml` by hand.

> Cross-reference: the dedicated entries for the two config-load failures live under
> [`raxd serve`](#configuration-load-errors-share-one-generic-hint) above, including the note that an
> invalid `config.yaml` and an invalid `bind_addr` share one generic hint. An invalid
> `upload.max_file_bytes` / `upload.default_mode` is also a startup failure — its `error:` line names
> the upload field.

## Paths and `$HOME`

### `error: cannot determine config directory: $HOME is not set`

`raxd` could not resolve your home directory.

```
error: cannot determine config directory: $HOME is not set
  hint: set the HOME environment variable and try again
```

Set `HOME` (or the relevant `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` / `XDG_STATE_HOME`) and retry. In a container, make
sure the user running `raxd` has a home directory set.

> The system service avoids this by setting `HOME` (and `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` / `XDG_STATE_HOME`)
> explicitly in the unit/plist, so the unprivileged `raxd` user — which has no normal home — still
> resolves system paths. See
> [`configuration.md`](configuration.md#service-layout-system-service).
